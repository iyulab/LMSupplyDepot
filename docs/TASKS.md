## ðŸŽ¯ Platform Positioning & Architecture

### **LMSupplyDepots = Model Serving Layer**
- **NOT an LLM Framework** (like LangChain, Semantic Kernel)
- **IS a Model Serving Platform** (like GPU Stack, LM Studio, Ollama)
- **Provides**: Low-level model loading, inference, tool execution APIs
- **Enables**: LLM frameworks to connect and orchestrate models

### **Current Architecture**
```
LLM Frameworks (LangChain, Semantic Kernel, etc.)
                    â†“ (HTTP/gRPC API calls)
              LMSupplyDepots Host
                    â†“ (thin wrapper)
              LMSupplyDepots SDK
                    â†“
           Model Loading & Inference Engines
```
